== Kubernetes Static Site Deployment

This script makes it easy to get started with a staging/production
static site pushed out to Kubernetes.  It is designed to be copied
into your app so that you can modify it to suit your needs.  It
currently is designed to use a custom load balancer, but can easily be
modified to support Ingress rules.
